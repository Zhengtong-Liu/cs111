lab1a.c 
    the source module
    the program is implemented to have two modes:
        the default mode, where the keyboard is set into character-at-a-time,
    no-echo mode, and the input is manually processed before displaying it on
    the terminal;
        the --shell option mode, where the input from keyboard is sent both to
    the terminal to display to the user, and to shell to execute. The stdout
    and stderr from shell is also displayed to the user through terminal. This
    option employs the fork function to create two processes and APIs like pipe
    to enable inter-process communication.

Makefile
    the targets in the Makefile includes
        default(the same as lab1a)
        lab1a:
            compile the program with -Wall and -Wextra program,
            produce the lab1a executable
        clean:
            clean the files created be Makefile
        dist:
            create the tarball to be submitted


To test my source code, I ran the sanity check and tried several inputs myself. The error
information written in a meaningful way when a system call fails also helps me to test and
debug my program.
