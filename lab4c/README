    lab4c_tcp.c lab4c_tls.c ... 
        C source files for two embedded applications (lab4c_tcp and lab4c_tls) that 
        build and run (with no errors or warnings) on a Beaglebone.

        lab4c_tcp.c ...
            builds and runs on the Beaglebone
            based on the temperature sensor application (project 4b)
            accept the following (mandatory) new parameters:
                --id=9-digit-number
                --host=name or address
                --log=filename
                port number
            accepts the same commands and generates the same reports as project 4b
            but now I/O from/to a network connection to a server

        lab4c_tls.c ...
            similar as lab4c_tcp.c, except that now the communication with socket
            is encrypted/decrypted using TLS APIs
